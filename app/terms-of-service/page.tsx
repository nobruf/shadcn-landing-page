            automatically to ensure you’re using the latest version. Our
            software may include open source software that is governed by its

          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Corporate domains.</strong> If you create an account using
            an email address owned by an organization (for example, your
            employer), that account may be added to the organization&#39;s
            business account with us, in which case we will provide notice to
            you so that you can help facilitate the transfer of your account
            (unless your organization has already provided notice to you that it
            may monitor and control your account). Once your account is
            transferred, the organization’s administrator will be able to
            control your account, including being able to access Content
            (defined below) and restrict or remove your access to the

            Party Services and Third Party Output are subject to their own

          <h2 id="content">Content</h2>
          <p>
            <strong>Your content.</strong> You may provide input to the Services
            (“Input”), and receive output from the Services based on the Input
            (“Output”). Input and Output are collectively “Content.” You are
            responsible for Content, including ensuring that it does not violate
            any applicable law or these Terms. You represent and warrant that
            you have all rights, licenses, and permissions needed to provide
            Input to our Services.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Ownership of content.</strong> As between you and GrimoAI,
            and to the extent permitted by applicable law, you (a) retain your
            ownership rights in Input and (b) own the Output. We hereby assign
            to you all our right, title, and interest, if any, in and to
            Output.&#x20;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Similarity of content.</strong> Due to the nature of our
            Services and artificial intelligence generally, output may not be
            unique and other users may receive similar output from our Services.
            Our assignment above does not extend to other users’ output or any
            Third Party Output.&#x20;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Our use of content.</strong> We may use Content to provide,
            maintain, develop, and improve our Services, comply with applicable
            law, enforce our terms and policies, and keep our Services
            safe.&#x20;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Opt out.</strong> If you do not want us to use your Content
            to provide personalized improvement, you can opt out by following
            the instructions in the help center. Please note that in some cases
            this may limit the ability of our Services to better address your
            specific use case.&#x20;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Accuracy.</strong> Artificial intelligence and machine
            learning are rapidly evolving fields of study. We are constantly
            working to improve our Services to make them more accurate,
            reliable, safe, and beneficial. Given the probabilistic nature of
            machine learning, use of our Services may, in some situations,
            result in Output that does not accurately reflect real people,
            places, or facts.&#x20;
          </p>
          <p>When you use our Services you understand and agree:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Output may not always be accurate. You should not rely on Output
                from our Services as a sole source of truth or factual
                information, or as a substitute for professional advice.
              </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                You must evaluate Output for accuracy and appropriateness for
                your use case, including using human review as appropriate,
                before using or sharing Output from the Services.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                You must not use any Output relating to a person for any purpose
                that could have a legal or material impact on that person, such
                as making credit, educational, employment, housing, insurance,
                legal, medical, or other important decisions about them.&#x20;

                Our Services may provide incomplete, incorrect, or offensive
                Output that does not represent GrimoAI’s views. If Output
                references any third party products or services, it doesn’t mean
                the third party endorses or is affiliated with GrimoAI.

            <strong>Billing.</strong> If you purchase any Services, you will
            provide complete and accurate billing information, including a valid

            cancel. You’re responsible for all applicable taxes, and we’ll
            charge tax when required. If your payment cannot be completed, we
            may downgrade your account or suspend your access to our Services
            until payment is received.&#x20;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Cancellation.</strong> You can cancel your paid subscription
            at any time. Payments are non-refundable, except where required by
            law. These Terms do not override any mandatory local laws regarding
            your cancellation rights.&#x20;
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Changes.</strong> We may change our prices from time to
            time. If we increase our subscription prices, we will give you at
            least 30 days’ notice and any price increase will take effect on
            your next renewal so that you can cancel if you do not agree to the
            price increase.

            remedy exists at law if you breach Section 3 (Use of Our Services);
            (b) it would be difficult to determine the damages resulting from
            such breach, and any such breach would cause irreparable harm; and
            (c) a grant of injunctive relief provides the best remedy for any

            <strong>Delay in enforcing these Terms.</strong> Our failure to
            enforce a provision is not a waiver of our right to do so later.
            Except as provided in the dispute resolution section above, if any
            portion of these Terms is determined to be invalid or unenforceable,
            that portion will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and
            it will not affect the enforceability of any other terms.
